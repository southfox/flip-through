Develop an iOS mobile app that will display public photos from flickr™ using objective C. 
http://www.flickr.com/ 

Details:
The app display a collection of small images with pagination and provide the ability to display a larger version of any image once you touch it.

The app launch quickly, remain responsive at all times, is intuitive to use, and it's fully tested.

There are some asynchronous requests and caching so the user can go through pictures without blocking call and with decent speed.

TBD:

There are additional functionality such as displaying photos for a particular user or tag or location.

There are third party libraries, but I DON’T use a pre-baked flickr client like ObjectiveFlickr https://github.com/lukhnos/objectiveflickr

The application it's using the public flickr feed which does not require authentication: http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/
