Develop an iOS mobile app that will display public photos from flickrâ„¢ using objective C. 
http://www.flickr.com/ 

Details:
The app display a collection of small images with pagination and provide the ability to display a larger version of any image once you touch it.

The app launch quickly, remain responsive at all times, is intuitive to use, and it's fully tested.

There are some asynchronous requests and caching so the user can go through pictures without blocking call and with decent speed.
Now it's using the public flickr feed which does not require authentication: http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/

When you start the application it querys 40 items in a feed, parse the information and shows all the pictures in a collection view.
Scrolling vertically a new query is made with the 20 next items.

CocoaPods is integrated (it's a library dependency manager, is very good for integrate frameworks in iOS applications).
- RestKit, Reachability are always my first choices in CocoaPods

Services implemented and used:
- Serialization: implements a good shared resource inside the application to save information locally. It serializes the model data into a json file, and recover the file when the application become active. I'll use this service when the application is offline.
- Reachability: to know when there is network available.
- Parse: there a couple of tables with the configuration in parse.com, the information of the user
- Analytics: it works with flurry, parse log, Google Analytics
- Crash:
    Crittercism is the crash framework. Inside Analytics is a good place to leave the crumbs.
    Crashlytics is another crash framework. Very good framework, you don't need to upload syms.
    Testflight has a crash detector. It's integrated in the app.
- With flickr the use is restriced to services that does not require authentication. Now it's using the public flickr feed which does not require authentication: http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/
- In full screen mode the photo is edited by using Aviary
- You can share the photo with Facebook, Twitter or Email.

I'm implementing a toolbar when should be available the following actions:
- [folder] where you can draw and drop your favourites photos 
- [trash] deleted photos
- [filter] filter the actual list
- [format] I'm adding formats of pictures: jpeg, png, pdf. Using pdf will generate a pdf with all the pictures in the folder.
- [first] navigation: go to first photo
- [prev] navigation: go to previuos photo
- [info] navigation: show the information of the actual photo (flickr tags, links, descriptions)
- [next] navigation: go to next photo
- [last] navigation: go to last photo
- [help] I'll provide a help / tutorial system

In the full screen mode:
- Aviary button: to edit the photo using Aviary fwk
- Facebook: upload (simply upload the photo into Facebook system) or share the photo using a title/message
- Twitter: share
- Email: send and email with the photo
- [info] navigation: show the information of the actual photo (flickr tags, links, descriptions)
- [prev] navigation: go to previuos photo
- [next] navigation: go to next photo
- [last] navigation: go to last photo
- [help] I'll provide a help / tutorial system
- [format] I'm adding formats of pictures: jpeg, png, pdf. Using pdf will generate a pdf with all the pictures in the folder.
- [trash] delete the photo
- [close] close button

I'll replace the iOS regular Alert with a view


TBD:

In the future I'll add:
- in full screen mode: accept gesture recognizers to magnify the image (pinch).
- There are additional functionality such as displaying photos for a particular user or tag or location.
- share icon or social link (Be the first to know about updates and new features!) or "Got it!": mail, facebook, tweet, linkedin, google+, Pinterest, digg, StumbleUpon, Reddit, Tumblr, Adtty, Allvoices, Amazon Wishlist, Arto, Baidu, Bebo, Blinklist, Blip, Blogmarks, Blogger, Brainity, BuddyMarks, Buffer, Add to BX, Care2, chiq, CiteULike, Connotea, coRank, Corcboard, Current, Dealspi.us, Delicius, Digg, Diigo, .net Shoutout, DZone, Edmodo and flickr off course.
- show banner, views and video ads: new service FTAdService (only if the user didn't purchase)
- IAP: purchase the full pack ?


Bug fixing: I found that the JSON parser is not parsing very well when there are escaped single quotes in a string: Fixed bug on JSON parser, does not support escaped single quotes. The problem was inside: +++ b/flip-through/Pods/RestKit/Code/Support/RKNSJSONSerialization.m A simple replace of the escaped single quote fixed that for now.  It's a problem in JSONKit inside RestKit.
